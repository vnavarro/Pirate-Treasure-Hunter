This project have the goal to produce a small beta game that has some art, music, sound, animation and code all of them using Microsoft XNA Framework.

The visual assests and the code were all made by me and can be use for open source projects, unfortunately the songs and music are from open source projects but follow their on license rules, which I didn't stored in the project (sorry!).

It is an open source project (as listed by the MIT license bellow) so feel free to use this for your own tests and to contact me if any help is needed I'd be glad to help and learn a bit more.
